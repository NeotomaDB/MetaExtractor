# MetaExtractor: Finding Fossils in the Literature

This project aims to identify research articles which are relevant to the [Neotoma Paleoecological Database](http://neotomadb.org) (Neotoma), extract data relevant to Neotoma from the article, and provide a mechanism for the data to be reviewed by Neotoma data stewards then submitted to Neotoma. It is being completed as part of the University of British Columbia (UBC) [Masters of Data Science (MDS) program](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/) in partnership with the [Neotoma Paleoecological Database](http://neotomadb.org).
